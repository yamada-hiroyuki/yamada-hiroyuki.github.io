American Airlines operates flight AAL1843 from KCLT Charlotte Douglas to KBOS Boston Logan. On January 9, 2025, I captured aerial pictures looking out the left side of the airplane. This is a curated set of those pictures, highlighting more than 35 cities and towns along the northeast corridor.

The Boston-Washington Megalopolis spans some 400 miles, comprising over 50 million residents.

I enjoyed the flight, and hope you enjoy the pictures. Picture locations should be accurate to the position of the aircraft when the image was captured, to within a margin of about 1/4 mi.
