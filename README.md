American Airlines operates flight AAL1843 from CLT Charlotte Douglas to BOS Boston Logan. On January 9, 2025, I captured over a hundred aerial pictures looking out the left side of the aircraft, a 737-800. This is a curated set of some of those pictures, highlighting some 35+ cities and towns along the northeast corridor.

The Boston-Washington Megalopolis spans the some 400 miles, comprising some 50 million residents.

I enjoyed the flight, and hope you enjoy the pictures. Picture locations should be accurate to the position of the aircraft when the image was captured, to within a margin of about 1/4 mi.
